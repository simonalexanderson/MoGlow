MoGlow is a new deep-learning architecture for creating high-quality animation. Its key advantages include:

1. It is *general*. Unlike most prior work in motion generation, the same method works for generating a wide variety of motion types, such as diverse human locomotion, dog locomotion, and arm and body gestures driven by speech.
2. It is *controllable*: Output motion can be conditioned on an arbitrary control input, such as which direction to walk, used to achieve interactive control over the output motion without algorithmic latency.
3. It is *probabilistic*, and learns an entire distribution of plausible output motions that are consistent with the desired control.

Evaluations show that MoGlow produces convincingly natural motion and approaches state-of-the-art performance on each application we tested it on â€“ despite the fact that MoGlow is completely general and free from task-specific assumptions, whereas each state-of-the-art method is custom-designed for a single task only.

For more information, please [see our introduction video](https://youtu.be/pe-YTvavbtA) below and [our main paper published at SIGGRAPH Asia 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06598). [Code and motion data are publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/simonalexanderson/StyleGestures). We have also published follow-up work where [we extended the method to allow stylistic control and applied it to gesture generation](https://youtu.be/egf3tjbWBQE), and [applied similar ideas to generate facial expressions in response to a conversation partner](https://patrikjonell.se/projects/lets_face_it/). The approach has won and been nominated for several awards.
